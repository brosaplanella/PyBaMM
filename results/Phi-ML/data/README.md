# Definition of the datasets

## Concentration of the electrolyte (ce)

### Full discharge
* ce_1C_full_discharge_2h_rest: full discharge at 1C constant current, followed by a 2 hour long rest period.
* ce_15C_full_discharge_2h_rest: full discharge at 1.5C constant current, followed by a 2 hour long rest period.
* ce_C2_full_discharge_2h_rest: full discharge at C/2 constant current, followed by a 2 hour long rest period.

### Pulses
* ce_1C_pulse_1min_rest_1min: series of pulses of 1C discharge for 1 minute followed by one minute of rest (60 repetitions)
* ce_2C_pulse_1min_rest_1min: series of pulses of 2C discharge for 1 minute followed by one minute of rest (22 repetitions)
